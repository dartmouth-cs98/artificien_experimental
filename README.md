# Artificien: Experimental

This repo stores Jupyter Notebooks used as examples to test the federated learning workflow of the Artificien platform.

* Counting_statistics.ipynb is a notebook that creates fake workers, sends a tensor to each of the fake workers, and then generates counting statistics of the set of workers (grid).
* regressions.ipynb is a notebook that creates fake workers, sends a tensor for data and outcome to each of these workers, and then runs a regression on the set of workers.
